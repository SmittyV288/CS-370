- Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
    
    - I was tasked with completing the Q-Training algorithm for a game where a pirate had to find a treasure in a maze. I was given starter code that provided most of what I needed for it to function. I needed to complete the qtrain function which involved training the neural network based on its experience via exploitation or exploration. 
      
- Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science
    
    - What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
        
        - Computer scientists develop and analyze systems and software to solve complex problems. It matters because in our world of technology, we need their innovation in order to handle a variety of things such as artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.
    
    -  How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
        
        - I would approach a problem by first trying to break it down into smaller parts. From there, I would try to get those parts working properly before integrating them together to solve the problem. 
    
    - What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
        
        - My ethical responsibility to the end user is to make sure what they're using is safe and secure. I need to try, to the best of my ability, to make sure that their privacy and rights are protected. My ethical responsibilities to the organization are to maintain data integrity, follow ethical guidelines, and avoid conflicts of interest.
